Time Series Analysis with Event Influence
------------------------------------------

This project aims to forecast the Moroccan economy by predicting key economic indicators using time series models. It uniquely incorporates the influence of significant events (such as holidays, crises, reforms, etc.) occurring during the year. The data is zero-padded monthly to maintain consistent time granularity.

The project features a clean and interactive Streamlit interface for visualizing and exploring forecasts in real-time.

Overview
----------

Economic forecasting is essential for policy makers, investors, and researchers. This project goes beyond standard forecasting by:

* Modeling economic indicators on a monthly basis.
* Including event data (e.g., major holidays, external shocks).
* Leveraging Streamlit for intuitive exploration and prediction.

Features
--------

Zero-Padded Monthly Data
    Ensures complete time series continuity.

Event-Aware Modeling
    Events are integrated into the feature set to enhance model sensitivity to real-world occurrences.

Live Predictions
    Users can interact with the forecast through a Streamlit dashboard.

Modular Codebase
    Easy to maintain and extend.

How to Run
-----------

Clone the Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/MA-Zbida/Time-Series-Analysis.git
    cd Time-Series-Analysis

Install Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r Time-Series-Analysis/src/requirements.txt

Start the Streamlit App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    streamlit run Time-Series-Analysis/src/app.py
    
Example Forecasted Indicators
-----------------------------

* IDE
* REER
* Employment Rate
* Import/Export Volumes

These indicators are predicted with respect to both time and known impactful events.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

* Integration of high-frequency or regional data
* Use chatbot for automated event extraction from news and their intensity
